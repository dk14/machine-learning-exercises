Draft: Machine Learning (Deep vs Reinforcement) experiments presented as Jupyter-notebooks (Scala)

Sources:
 - "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto
 - "Deep Learning" Ian Goodfellow et al.

P.S. It's best to view examples in nbviewer, so you could get plot renderings for Scala-scripts.
