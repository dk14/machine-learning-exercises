# machine-learning-exercises
Draft: Machine Learning (Deep vs Reinforcement) experiments presented as Jupyter-notebooks (Scala)

[Example1](https://github.com/dk14/machine-learning-exercises/blob/master/octaveAndRintegrationExample.ipynb). Integration with Octave and R

[Example2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dk14/machine-learning-exercises/blob/4b74493bf2f3c854ad79652e548a8dd000eb989a/MultiBandit.ipynb). Simple bandit (slot-machine) algorithm for reinforcement learning

[Example3](https://github.com/dk14/machine-learning-exercises/blob/master/MNIST.ipynb). Multi-layer network trained on MNIST digits (using deeplearning4j library)

 - "Deep Learning" Ian Goodfellow et al.

P.S. It's best to view examples in nbviewer, so you could get plot renderings for Scala-scripts.
